# 📁 Projects

This folder contains individual project directories from my data science and analytics work. Each subfolder includes its own README with details, code, and datasets where applicable.

## How this folder is organized

- Each project has its **own subfolder** (for example: `bangla-agricultural-advisor-chatbot`, `students-mental-health-dashboard`, `coffee-shop-sales-analysis`, `ecommerce-customer-behavior-dashboard`).
- Inside every project folder you will typically find:
  - `README.md` – Short description, goals, and results.
  - `notebooks/` – Jupyter or R notebooks used for analysis and modeling.
  - `data/` – Sample or processed datasets (if shareable).
  - `src/` – Source code (scripts, modules, utility functions).
  - `reports/` or `figures/` – Visualizations, dashboards, and summary reports.
