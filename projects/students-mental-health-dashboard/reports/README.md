# Dashboard Reports

This folder contains exported views of the **Students Mental Health Dashboard – A Statistical Approach**.  
The PDF file shows the main dashboard layout and key visualizations used to monitor stress, anxiety, financial stress, and related indicators among students.

These static reports are intended for quick review and for sharing the dashboard look with recruiters, educators, and other stakeholders who may not have direct access to the Power BI file or service.  
For full interactivity, filters, and drill‑downs, please open the accompanying `.pbix` file from the project root in Power BI Desktop.
